QUe for iOS
=======

QUe is a mobile conference app solution best suited for multitrack conferences.

#Usage
In order to get things started, this version already includes data of a sample conference: author names and affiliations are generated by [Fake Name Generator](http://www.fakenamegenerator.com), and papers by [SCIgen](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/).

The app is able to work without any internet connection. However, it is designed to pull updates from a remote server (that is not yet available under an open source license). Be sure to check the constants listed in *QUe/ConferenceConstants.h* and remove any server calls if you want to use the app only offline.
